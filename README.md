This repository contains solutions for two questions (Q1 and Q2) of the assignment.
-	Q1 Folder
	-	data/: Contains four images of coins (1.png, 2.png, etc.).
	-	2_output/: Stores the processed outputs for 2.png.
	-	Q1.ipynb and q1.py: Contains the implementation of the solution for Q1.
 
-	Q2 Folder
 	-	data/: Includes two example folders (example_1 and example_2) containing images for processing.
	-	example_1_output/: Stores the processed output images for the first example set.
	-	Q2.ipynb and q2.py: Contains the implementation of the solution for Q2.

Each .ipynb file contains a Jupyter Notebook version of the solution, while the .py script provides the corresponding Python implementation.

# PART-A
# Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting

## Overview
This part uses computer vision techniques to detect, segment, and count coins from an image containing scattered Indian coins. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or later).
and install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy 
```

## Steps to Run

- There are both jupter notebook (prefered) and normal python file for the same code available
- Clone the repo and follow the given steps
- Follow the given input and output directory structures 

Running the Python Script (Q1.py)
1.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.	Navigate to the Q1 folder:
```
cd Q1
```

3.	Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy argparse
```

4.	Run the script:
```
python Q1.py
```


Running the Jupyter Notebook (Q1.ipynb)
1.	Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed:
```
pip install jupyter
```

2.	Navigate to the Q1 folder:

```
cd Q1
```

3.	Launch Jupyter Notebook or Open in Google Colab/ Vs code :

```
jupyter notebook
```
Run the cells in sequential order 

## Steps

###  1. User Input
- The script first asks user for input image path  and output directory to save the processed images:

### 2. Preprocessing the Image
- Convert the image to grayscale.
- Resize while maintaining aspect ratio (max_dim == 1000).
- Apply Gaussian blur (7x7).
- Uses adaptive thresholding for better edge detection.

### 3. Coin Detection
- Find contours in the thresholded image.
- Filter out circular objects based on perimeter and area.
- Visualize detected coins by outlining them in blue.

### 4. Coin Segmentation
- Create a binary mask based on detected contours.
- Extract segmented coin images on a black background.
- Save the segmented image.

### 5. Individual Coin Extraction
- Extract each detected coin using minimum enclosing circles.
- Crop and save each coin separately.

### 6. Coin Counting
- Counts the total number of detected coins.
- Displays the count as an console output.

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Google Colab or JupyterLab.
2. Upload an image containing scattered Indian coins.
3. Run the cells sequentially to process the image and obtain results.

## Expected Outputs
- `edges_detected.jpg`: Image with detected coin contours outlined.
- `segments.jpg`: Image with segmented coins on a black background.
- `coin_X.jpg`: Individual extracted coins.
- Console Output: Total number of detected coins.


## Sample Input 

### 1. Original Image (Sample Input)

![Sample Input Image](Q1/data/2.png)

This is the original image that will be processed.

## Sample Output

### 1. Edge Detection (Expected Output)

![Edge Detection](Q1/data/2_output/edges_detected.jpg)

Edges of objects in the image are detected using Canny edge detection.

### 2. Image Segmentation (Expected Output)

![Segmented Image](Q1/data/2_output/segments.jpg)

The image is segmented based on intensity values.

### 2. Individual Coins Cropped   (Expected Output)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_0.jpg)
![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_1.jpg)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_2.jpg)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_3.jpg)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_4.jpg)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_5.jpg)

![coin Image](Q1/data/2_output/coin_6.jpg)


The individual images for each coins detected

### 4. Number of coins (Expected Console Output)

```
7 coins detected
```

![Segmented Image](Q1/data/2_output/console.png)
Ensure that all input images are placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.


# PART-B
# Image Stitching using OpenCV

## Overview
This part performs image stitching using SIFT feature detection and homography transformation to align and merge images into a panoramic view. It reads a sequence of images, detects keypoints, matches them, computes a homography matrix, and stitches images together.


## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the required dependencies using:
```bash

pip install numpy opencv-python imutils tqdm argparse
```

## Steps to Run

- There are both jupter notebook (prefered) and normal python file for the same code available
- Clone the repo and follow the given steps
- Follow the given input and output directory structures 

Running the Python Script (Q2.py)
1.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.	Navigate to the Q1 folder:
```
cd Q2
```

3.	Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy argparse
```

4.	Run the script:
```
python Q2.py
```


Running the Jupyter Notebook (Q2.ipynb)
1.	Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed:
```
pip install jupyter
```

2.	Navigate to the Q2 folder:

```
cd Q2
```

3.	Launch Jupyter Notebook or Open in Google Colab/ Vs code :


```
jupyter notebook
```
Run the cells in sequential order.


## Steps

###  1. User Input
- The script first asks user for input and output directories path
- The input directory must contain images named in sequential numerical order, such as 1.png, 2.png, â€¦, N.png. The output directory will store the generated panorama image, which will be saved as panorama.jpg.

###  2. Read & Sort Images
- The script reads images from the input directory.
- It filters out non-numeric filenames and sorts them in numerical order.

###  3. Load the First Image
- Reads and resizes the first image to 600px width for consistency.


###  4. Detect Keypoints & Descriptors using SIFT
- Uses the SIFT algorithm to extract feature points from each image by looping over the input images.


### 5. Match Keypoints using KNN & Apply Ratio Test
- Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to match features between consecutive images.
- Applies Loweâ€™s ratio test (0.75 threshold) to filter good matches.


### 6. Compute Homography & Warp Image
- Homography matrix aligns one image onto the next.
- Uses cv2.RANSAC with a threshold of 5.0 for  transformation.


### 7. Blend & Stitch Images
- The right image is blended onto the warped perspective of the left image.
- Crops excess black areas using contours & bounding box extraction.

### 8. Repeat
- The combined images becomes the left image now and the next image will be merged repating the above steps
