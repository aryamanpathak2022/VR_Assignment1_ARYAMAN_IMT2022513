# Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting

## Overview
This project uses computer vision techniques to detect, segment, and count coins from an image containing scattered Indian coins. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Steps

### 1. Preprocessing the Image
- Convert the image to grayscale.
- Resize while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Apply Gaussian blur.
- Use adaptive thresholding for better edge detection.

### 2. Coin Detection
- Find contours in the thresholded image.
- Filter out circular objects based on perimeter and area.
- Visualize detected coins by outlining them in green.

### 3. Coin Segmentation
- Create a binary mask based on detected contours.
- Extract segmented coin images on a black background.
- Save the segmented image.

### 4. Individual Coin Extraction
- Extract each detected coin using minimum enclosing circles.
- Save each coin separately.

### 5. Coin Counting
- Count the total number of detected coins.
- Display the count as an output.

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in Google Colab or JupyterLab.
2. Upload an image containing scattered Indian coins.
3. Run the cells sequentially to process the image and obtain results.

## Expected Outputs
- `edges_detected.jpg`: Image with detected coin contours outlined.
- `segments.jpg`: Image with segmented coins on a black background.
- `coin_X.jpg`: Individual extracted coins.
- Console Output: Total number of detected coins.


## Sample Input 

### 1. Original Image (Sample Input)

![Sample Input Image](images/sample_input.jpg)

This is the original image that will be processed.

## Sample Output

### 1. Grayscale Conversion (Expected Output)

![Grayscale Image](images/grayscale_output.jpg)

The original image is converted into grayscale.

### 2. Edge Detection (Expected Output)

![Edge Detection](images/edge_output.jpg)

Edges of objects in the image are detected using Canny edge detection.

### 3. Image Segmentation (Expected Output)

![Segmented Image](images/segmentation_output.jpg)

The image is segmented based on intensity values.

### 4. Number of coins (Expected Console Output)

```
6 coins detected
```

Ensure that all input images are placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.


# Image Stitching using OpenCV

## Overview
This project performs image stitching using SIFT feature detection and homography transformation to align and merge images into a panoramic view. It reads a sequence of images, detects keypoints, matches them, computes a homography matrix, and stitches images together.


## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the required dependencies using:
```bash

pip install numpy opencv-python imutils tqdm argparse
```

## Steps

###  1. Read & Sort Images
- The script first asks user for input and output directories path
- The input directory must contain images named in sequential numerical order, such as 1.png, 2.png, â€¦, N.png. The output directory will store the generated panorama image, which will be saved as panorama.jpg.

###  2. Read & Sort Images
- The script reads images from the input directory.
- It filters out non-numeric filenames and sorts them in numerical order.

###  3. Load the First Image
- Reads and resizes the first image to 600px width for consistency.


###  4. Detect Keypoints & Descriptors using SIFT
- Uses the SIFT algorithm to extract feature points from each image by looping over the input images.


### 5. Match Keypoints using KNN & Apply Ratio Test
- Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to match features between consecutive images.
- Applies Loweâ€™s ratio test (0.75 threshold) to filter good matches.


### 6. Compute Homography & Warp Image
- Homography matrix aligns one image onto the next.
- Uses cv2.RANSAC with a threshold of 5.0 for  transformation.


### 7. Blend & Stitch Images
- The right image is blended onto the warped perspective of the left image.
- Crops excess black areas using contours & bounding box extraction.

### 8. Repeat
- The combined images becomes the left image now and the next image will be merged repating the above steps
